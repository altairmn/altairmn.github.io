Tomorrow will come today  
You be ready with your suit and your jacket  
Your smile, ready to crank it  
For if you're not prepared, it'll pass  
You by as surely as today has  
And then again you will lament  
the hands on the dial won't ever relent  
And as they pose when moon comes up  
Your spirits drop, your breath lets up  
"Oh why can't I unravel in nature-like  
No beginnings, no ends, just motion  
And set a-swim like a pike  
Into the endless ocean"
